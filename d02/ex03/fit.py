    Description:
    Fits the model to the training dataset contained in x and y.
    Args:
    x: has to be a numpy.array, a matrix of dimension m * n:
    (number of training examples, number of features).
    y: has to be a numpy.array, a vector of dimension m * 1:
    (number of training examples, 1).
    theta: has to be a numpy.array, a vector of dimension (n + 1) * 1:
    (number of features + 1, 1).
    alpha: has to be a float, the learning rate
    max_iter: has to be an int, the number of iterations done during the gradient descent
    Return:
